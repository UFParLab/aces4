/**
 * This class manages tags in a way that supports the barrier implementation, and also
 * provides each transaction with a unique id.
 *
 * A barrier in SIAL is implemented with a distributed termination detection algorithm in the SIP.
 * This class attempts to encapsulate the implementation of the termination detection algorithm.
 *
 * Termination Detection algorithm:
 *
 * There are two types of processes involved--workers and servers.  A SIAL program proceeds in
 * a sequence of "sections" separated by barriers. The SIP maintains the current section number
 * at each worker, and the latest section seen at each server.  All messages from workers to
 * servers are acknowledged--either by replying to a request for data or with an explicit ack.
 * Termination of the current section follows from the condition that
 * for all workers:  worker is at the barrier and all messages sent by the worker have been acked.
 * Thus when a worker reaches a barrier, it waits until all of its messages have been acked and
 * invokes an MPI barrier.  Global termination of the section is indicated by termination of the
 * MPI barrier.
 *
 * The server updates its section number each time it receives a message, and checks that the sequence
 * of section numbers is monotone.
 *
 *
 *
 * Other considerations:
 *
 * It is useful for each "transaction" initiated by a worker to have a unique identifier. To
 * accomplish this, a transaction counter is also maintained.  Each message belonging to a transaction--
 * for example the put and corresponding put_data messages--has the same transaction number.
 * The section number, transaction number, and message type are combined to form the message tag.
 *
 * Because this class is entirely small inlined functions, it does not have a corresponding .cpp file.
 *
